# Lotto Number Recommender

## Overview

This project is a simple, visually appealing web application that generates and displays a set of 6 unique lottery numbers. The goal is to provide a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface for generating random numbers for a typical "6/45" lottery game.

## Design and Features

*   **UI/UX:**
    *   A clean, centered layout with a modern aesthetic.
    *   A prominent "Generate Numbers" button to initiate the number generation.
    *   A visually distinct area where the 6 generated lottery numbers are displayed as colored balls.
    *   Subtle animations or transitions for a smoother user experience.
    *   Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Background: A soft, off-white or light gray.
    *   Title: A dark, easily readable color.
    *   Button: A vibrant, attention-grabbing color with a clear call-to-action.
    *   Number Balls: Colors will be assigned based on the number's range (e.g., 1-10 yellow, 11-20 blue, etc.) to mimic real lottery balls.

*   **Functionality:**
    *   When the user clicks the "Generate Numbers" button, the application will:
        1.  Generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
        2.  Sort the numbers in ascending order.
        3.  Display the numbers inside circular elements (balls).
        4.  Apply a different color to each ball based on its number range.
